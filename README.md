## Simple script to make it easier when cloning repos

<br>
<br>


## Install:

<br>

```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/WestleyK/easy-clone.git
cd easy-clone/
sudo ./install.sh
echo "source ~/easy-clone/auto-complete.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
```
<br>

And now you can clone repo much easier. <br>
Heres a example: <br>

```
hubget WestleyK/rpi-brightness
```
See, pretty simple. <br>
But now when you want to clone it again, just use TAB: <br>

```
hubget WestleyK/rp <TAB>
hubget WestleyK/rpi-brightness
```
